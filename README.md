# About Me
Hey there! I'm Mirko, and this project represents a significant milestone in my journey as a developer. With three years of experience in web development, I've decided to explore the exciting world of mobile app development using React Native. This Weather App is my very first React Native project, and I'm thrilled to share it with you.

As someone who previously worked primarily on web applications, diving into the world of mobile development has been both challenging and rewarding. I've learned a lot along the way and can't wait to continue improving and expanding this app.
